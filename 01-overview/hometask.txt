1. Create utility for storing file in filesystem.
   Command 'file.txt This is content of file' must create file.txt with content 'This is content of file'.
   Command 'path/to/file.txt This is content of file' must create file in
   - path
     - to
       file.txt
   If some directories are not existed, create them.
2. Create simple http server for getting files.
   GET request localhost:3000/file.txt must print content of file.txt.
   GET request localhost:3000/path/to/file.txt must print content of file.txt.
   If file is not found on path, return 404 error.
   If path contains some illegal symbols(.., *, ^ etc.) return 400 error.
